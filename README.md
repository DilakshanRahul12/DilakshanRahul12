# Hii ! I'm Dilakshan! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a passionate aspiring **AI Engineer**, **Machine Learning Engineer** and ****Data Engineer****. I work on various interesting projects involving **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, **AI**, and **Web Development**.

## Projects 🧑🏽‍💻

### 🔹 [**DiaTrack: A Data-Driven Approach for Improved Patient Care by Readmission, Mortality and Diabetic Predictions**](https://github.com/Chanidu-Edirisinghe/DSGP-G9)
- Spearheaded the development and implementation of the In-Hospital Mortality Risk Prediction Model, utilizing ICU data and machine learning to accurately estimate patient mortality risk.
- Contributed to the project's development lifecycle through active participation in team reviews, documentation, and testing, resulting in a high-performing model (Accuracy 91% | 72% macro-avg F1)
- Developed Frontend and backend with React and Flask

### 🔹 **Horse Racing Management System** ([Python](https://github.com/DilakshanRahul12/Horse-Management-System-Python-)/[Java](https://github.com/DilakshanRahul12/Horse-Management-System-Java))
- Developed a **CLI-based** horse racing management system in **Python** with **CRUD operations** and race visualization.
- Enhanced into a **GUI system using JavaFX**, introducing a rollback-inspired file management system.

### 🔹 [**Autonomous Robot Path Planning (Grid Maze Solver)**](https://github.com/DilakshanRahul12/Autonomous-Robot-Path-Planning)
- Created a **CLI-based maze generator** that builds a maze based on user-defined parameters.
- Implemented **A* algorithm** for efficient pathfinding, utilizing custom data structures.

### 🔹 [**NYRO: Personalized News Recommendation System**](https://github.com/DilakshanRahul12/CM2601_NYRO)
- JavaFX-based **news recommendation system** using **NLP and ML** for personalized article suggestions.
- Implemented **content-based filtering** with **Sentence Transformer ("paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2")**.
- Integrated **NewsAPI** for real-time updates and **PostgreSQL** for data storage.

### 🔹 [**Bank Term Deposit Subscription Prediction Using ML**](https://github.com/DilakshanRahul12/Bank-Term-Deposit-Subscription-Prediction-Using-ML)
- Used **Bank Marketing dataset** to predict term deposit subscriptions.
- Applied **SMOTE** for class imbalance, **PCA** for multicollinearity, and **ANN, Random Forest & Stacked Model** for classification.
- Achieved **79% F1-score** with a stacked model (RF + ANN + Logistic Regression).

### 🔹 [**Stock Price Prediction Challenge - INTELLIHACK 5.0**](https://github.com/SachithPathiranage/Intellihack_Pandas_and_Pythons_Task_4)
- Developed and evaluated **ML models (ARIMA, Linear Regression, LSTM, GRU, Random Forest, XGBoost)** for **5-day** stock price prediction.
- Conducted **EDA and feature engineering**, assessing models using **MAE and RMSE**.
- **Linear Regression** proved the most reliable for identifying trends and trading signals.
